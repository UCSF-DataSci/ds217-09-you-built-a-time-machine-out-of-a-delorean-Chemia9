TODO: Document your missing data handling:
- How many missing values did you find?
- What percentage of data was missing?
The total number of missing values in the upsampled daily temperature time series is 323, which constitutes approximately 96.42% of the total data points.
This is expected since we upsampled from monthly to daily frequency, which creates about 30 times more observations, with only 1/30 being non-missing.
- Which method did you use to fill missing values?
I chose the interpolation with time method to fill the missing values.
- Why did you choose that method?
Due to the structure of the missing data, where values are missing for long stretches of time between month-end observations, 
forward or backward fill could lead to large blocks of repeated values that do not reflect the true underlying trends.
On the other hand, since it is temporal data, and we would expect gradual changes over time, interpolation with time may provide a more realistic estimate of the missing values.
- What are the pros/cons of your approach?
Pros:
- Interpolation with time leverages the temporal structure of the data, providing estimates that reflect gradual changes over time.
- It avoids large blocks of repeated values that can occur with forward or backward fill, which may misrepresent the underlying trends.
Cons:
- Interpolation assumes that changes between observed values are linear or smooth, which may not always be the case in real-world data.
- It may not capture sudden changes or anomalies that could occur between observations.
